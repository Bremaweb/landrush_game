Wiki Mod
--------

Another random mod by me.

This mod provides a "Wiki" block. You can create and edit pages with it.

The pages are saved as <worldpath>/wiki/<pagename>. All spaces in the page name
are converted to underscores, and all other characters not in [A-Za-z0-9-] are
converted to hex notation %XX.

The text can contain hyperlinks in the form of [link text] to other pages. Such
links are added at the bottom of the form.

You can craft a "Wiki block" by putting 9 bookshelves in the crafting grid.

Only players with the "wiki" priv can create/edit pages.
